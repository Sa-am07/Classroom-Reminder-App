Virtual Classroom Reminder App is a web-based tool for managing academic reminders in online classrooms. The app lets teachers and students create, schedule, and receive notifications for assignments, exams, and events. Users register with basic details and log in to access a dashboard showing upcoming, completed, and overdue reminders. Teachers can assign reminders to groups or individuals, while students may set personal reminders. The system sends alerts by email or in-app notifications before deadlines. Reminders can be edited or deleted. Users can search and filter reminders by title, category, or due date.

The interface is mobile-responsive and works on any device with a browser and internet. Data security is ensured with encryption and authentication. The backend uses a relational database to manage users, reminders, notifications, and groups. The app supports many users at once and includes backup features for data safety. The design uses data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, and clear interface layouts. The project was developed as part of the BS Computer Science program at Virtual University of Pakistan. This repository contains the source code, database schema, and documentation needed to deploy or extend the app.
